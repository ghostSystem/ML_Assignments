Question 2:
2.4 -> astitv_1_temp.m (main implementation)
       validationData.m (computing accuracy, obj values, confusion matrix)

2.6 -> ques2.m (main implementation)
       homework.m (calling ques2.m from this class for iterations)
       test.m (checking for accuracy)


Question 3.4:
1 -> ques3.m (part 1 of question 3.4 solved)

2,3 -> hardnegative.m (main implementation of hard negative for SVM)
       calculateB.m (image analysis is done and B vector is formed)
       ques3_plots.m (making all the plots for obj_values and ap_values)


combine.m -> generating output.m files and running helper functions on validation data
